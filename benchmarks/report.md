# 📊 sys-opt Nightly Benchmark

Automated **CPU / RAM / disk** benchmarks (light stress via `psutil`) run every night on
**Linux, macOS and Windows** (GitHub-hosted runners). Each run is appended to
`benchmarks/<os>.json`; this report shows the latest run per OS and the recent history.

## Latest run per OS

| Metric | **macos-14** | **ubuntu-24.04** | **windows-2022** | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | 10.8 M ops/s | 7.0 M ops/s | 6.4 M ops/s |
| RAM | 22564 MB/s | 23096 MB/s | 21206 MB/s |
| Disk write | 4555 MB/s | 1310 MB/s | 123 MB/s |
| Disk read | 11719 MB/s | 7738 MB/s | 2864 MB/s |
| Elapsed | 1.1 s | 1.2 s | 1.3 s |
| **Overall verdict** | 🟢 Excellent | 🟢 Good | 🔴 Below average |

## How to read these numbers

| Metric | Meaning | Higher is |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | Floating-point operations per second (light compute loop) | better |
| **RAM** | Memory bandwidth measured with repeated buffer copies | better |
| **Disk write / read** | Sequential temp-file write/read speed (fsync included) | better |
| **Elapsed** | Total time the whole benchmark took | lower is better |

The **overall verdict** is the *lowest* tier among the measured
components: a machine is only as fast as its weakest part. Expect
realistic numbers on a GitHub-hosted runner to land in the
**Average** band — that is the baseline.

Run `python -m sys_opt --benchmark` on your own machine **before**
optimizing to get a baseline, then again **after** to measure the
improvement.
